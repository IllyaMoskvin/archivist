&#8230;many, many others need thanks and acknowledgment &#8211; especially those that helped me navigate in the early days, like J.G. in NYC, H.L. in Boston, and J.W. on the Internet, as well as W.A.T for workshop space, days on the range, and analog education (RIP, my friend) A. Silbernagel for support and intellectual camaraderie, A.C. for early software, and Biche for hanging in the shop on those cold, dark days.</p>
<p>Aaaaand&#8230; the entire DIY Book Scanner forum. A lot of people talk and write and blag on about &#8220;crowdsourcing&#8221;, but few people do it. <a href="http://diybookscanner.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;t=2467">If you want to see what crowdsourcing looks like, have a look at the problem-solving going on in this thread about the Hackerspace Scanner</a>. Thank you, everyone, for everything. For leading by example.</p>
