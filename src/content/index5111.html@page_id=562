The long edge is 16 3/8&#8243;, the short edge 12 inches. If you&#8217;re doing this in a metric country, +/-1mm should be OK.</p>
<p>This glass is sometimes called double strength glass, and it&#8217;s also called 3 millimeter glass referring to the thickness. On one long side there should be a mitered edge &#8212; a glass working term that means angled. I have used glass mitered at 45 degrees and shipped with each kit glass mitered at the ideal angle which is 50 degrees.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s difficult or impossible to get glass like this, you get one long edge sanded into what is called a pencil edge.</p>
