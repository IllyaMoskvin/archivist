<p>Each LED in the system draws 1.5 Amperes at 12V; because the LEDs are wired in parallel, that means that the total current draw is 3A at 12V. I decided to add a significant safety factor when purchasing the power supply, and bought a 12V, 5A supply from MPJA. These are medical-grade supplies which were surplused from CPAP machines. That&#8217;s an overall benefit because medical grade supplies are engineered to much higher standards and have more safety mechanisms and more stringent certifications than your average switcher. The leads are terminated with a 5.5/2.5mm barrel connector.</p>
