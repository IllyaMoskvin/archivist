<p><strong>&#8216;A&#8217; size or &#8216;A&#8217; series paper sizes:</strong> set of paper sizes established by the International Standards Organization (ISO) that ranges from 2A0 (the largest) to A7 (the smallest). The size of the paper goes down as the number goes up, and each is half the size of the previous i.e. two A4 sheets make up an A3 piece and two A5 sheets make up an A4 sheet. North America has a different, local standard. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_size">Read more</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Aperture:</strong> the size of the opening of the camera&#8217;s shutter. Aperture sizes are reported in F-numbers which are inversely proportional to the aperture size, so a 5.6 aperture setting is smaller than a 4 aperture setting. Aperture, along with shutter speed and ISO setting, determines the image&#8217;s effective exposure by determining the amount of light that reaches the camera&#8217;s sensor and the sensitivity of the sensor to the light. Some point and shoot cameras only have a minimal real aperture setting and instead fake a higher f-number by filtering out some of the incoming light. Aperture settings around 5.6 tend to result in pictures with the greatest sharpness. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aperture">Read more</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Polarizing filter:</strong> among other things polarizing filter allows you to remove unwanted reflections from non-metallic surfaces such as water or glass. There are two kinds of polarizing filters: linear and circular. The latter is mostly used with modern cameras. It&#8217;s an attachment to a lens on DSLR and some Point-and-Shoot cameras. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarizing_filter_(photography)">Read more</a>.</p>
<p><a name="portablescanner"></a><strong>Portable scanner:</strong> a scanner that doesn&#8217;t weight too much and can be carried on in a bag or in a backpack. Normally they come in the presentation of a hand scanner, but they can also be presented as a mouse or as a foldable structure to hold a smartphone and the book while scanning. In general, they can&#8217;t scan more than 300DPI, but they are a convenient solution to scan few books in-place.</p>
<p><strong>Postprocess:</strong> after scanning a book with an image scanner, the images needs to be edited to be converted into a digital book. This means that you need to crop, remove the borders and margins that aren&#8217;t needed, convert them into bitonal images, make OCR, and merge all the images in a single PDF or DJVU file, or apply proofreading and convert it into an EPUB. This process is not made in each image, one-by-one, but rather is applied in batch-processing, with all the software tools (and others) mentioned here.</p>
<p><strong>Public domain:</strong> the state that copyrighted works acquire after the copyright has expired or if copyright is inapplicable. This means that the works are free of charge to be used, copied, modified, or digitized. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain">Read more</a>.</p>

<p><strong>RaspberryPi:</strong> a credit-card sized computer, manufactured in the United Kingdom, that primarily uses Linux-kernel based operating systems. Read more on <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">the project page</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p><strong>RAW:</strong> a format of images on some cameras that is not pre-processed, and not compressed. While it is possible to start with these images for scanning, they are very large and require additional post-processing, so it is generally best to use high quality jpeg images as the source. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_image_format">Read more</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Remote control:</strong> in this context, is used to refer to enable remote control of the cameras, meaning that it&#8217;s not necessary to press the shutter each time to take photos.</p>

<p><strong>ScanTailor:</strong> a free-software tool to post-process scanned image. By far, it&#8217;s the most used tool by the DIY Book Scanner community. It comes with a Graphical User Interface, but can be used at also with a CLI.

<p><strong>SD card:</strong> a nonvolatile memory card. They have different speeds to read and write. This is not that important if you are performing typical actions, but that&#8217;s important when you want to do things like using a SD card to be the hard disk of your Raspberry Pi. In those cases, you&#8217;ll want a Class 10 SD card. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Digital">Read more</a>.</p>
<p><strong>SDM (Stereo Data Maker):</strong> a common software that is based on CHDK, that allows two canon cameras to be fired at the same time, by using modified USB cables and a switch. <a href="http://stereo.jpn.org/eng/sdm/index.htm">Read more</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Sheet feed scanner:</strong> see <a href="index57be.html@page_id=757#sheetfeed">Auto feed scanner</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Shutter speed:</strong> in a camera, stands for how long the shutter is open for. For example 1/60 is 1/60 of a second. This isn&#8217;t real critical for scanning because the book and the cameras should be stationary. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutter_speed">Read more</a>.</p>

<p><a name="whitebalance"></a><strong>White Balance:</strong> The setting on a camera to set the light type. Different types of light make a big difference on the final color of a scans. Cameras have settings like &#8220;tungsten&#8221; &#8220;cloudy&#8221;, &#8220;daylight&#8221; or manual. The goal of setting the white balance is to make the resulting colors accurate.</p>
