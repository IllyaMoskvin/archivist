<p>This lighting mount was manufactured from 1/16&#8243; black FR4, purchased from McMaster Carr. FR-4 is a composite material composed of woven fiberglass cloth with an epoxy resin binder that is flame resistant and self-extinguishing. I chose this material specifically for safety reasons. It&#8217;s also easy to process with a laser cutter (500W+) and/or a waterjet (although some care must be taken with the piercing so as not to delaminate the material). It can also be processed with a CNC router, but the resulting fiberglass dust must be carefully controlled. In all but the prototype, I used waterjet processing for its inherent dust control. One of the interesting things about waterjet fabrication is that holes are expensive because the machine must stop and pierce for each hole. For that reason, I turned the three holes around each of the circle output ports into slots, saving about $7/part.</p>
