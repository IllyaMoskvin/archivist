		<p><strong>This is the official assembly manual for the Archivist scanner</strong>. While prototyping the Archivist, I published <a href="http://makezine.com/projects/make-41-tinkering-toys/diy-book-scanner/">a guide in Make Magazine</a>. You should ignore that article &#8212; it&#8217;s incomplete, overcomplicated, and does not reflect the full design thinking that went into the Archivist. This site is more up-to-date and more complete.</p>
